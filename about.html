	    <h1> About </h1>

	   <p>I think I've always had a flair for creative design. When I was in college studying history of art, and then later architecture, I used to make hats and accessories for myself.</p>

	            <p> Then friends and family began to ask me to make some for them. I got some great feedback and that gave me the confidence (after I graduated from UCD) to sign up to study millinery at the Grafton Academy.  I loved it and it was there that I developed my style, which I would describe as sculptural rather than fussy. When I am designing a hat, I like to concentrate on form and structure, creating clean lines and striking silhouettes rather than too much adornment.</p>

	            <p> I like experimenting with both the traditional and more unusual materials-combining leather, fur felts, perspex and various straws to create something unique. But I have only recently focused exclusively on millinery. Along the way, I worked as a curator in an art gallery and for a time ran her own interior business (where I worked on private homes in the K club and others).</p>

	            <p>  I still work in interior design from time to time and I think you can see that coming through in my hat designs.  Having studied architecture and history of art, I have a real love of form and this influences my work as a milliner-from the concept and design of a hat right through to the physical building of it.</p>
